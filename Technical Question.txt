1. GMT is a specific time zone where as UTC is a time standard meaning countries do not use UTC for their own time but instead see it as a standard. https://www.timeanddate.com/time/gmt-utc-time.html
2. Asymmetric encryption is when the "keys" or functions the text goes through for encryption and decryption are different meaning if someone knew how to encrypt the data it doesn't mean they know how to decrypt it. Symmetric encryptions are when the encryption and decryption keys are the same. Hashing is different in that it is one way, when data is hashed it goes through a series of changes to make it one long string of characters and the computer uses that so if someone were to enter the same data into the hashing function it would return the same exact string.
3. The largest problem will be maintaining a sync between the servers otherwise it could be used as an exploit to access data that has yet to be changed.
4. You would need to take into consideration the the amount of data being stored, the price range, your expected traffic, etc.
5a. The code that you create gets uploaded to a fork in the branch on github, then it is reviewed by senior developers for any bugs or possible issues, and finally after approval it is pushed to the origin branch that gets updated on the live server every so often.
5b. After our code is developed we have it reviewed by team leaders and upper management which check it for any kind of problem the code could present to ensure reliability, finally after the code has been fully reviewed it is sent to our servers to be updated.
5c. When we finish writing our code it gets send to our manager and they check it for any problems, if they say it is okay that code is sent to update everyone who connects to our server.
